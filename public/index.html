      NOTE: The JavaScript redirect script from your example has been intentionally omitted. 
      That script is a workaround for hosts that have trouble with deep links in React apps (e.g., `yoursite.com/profile/123`).
      Because our app uses HashRouter (`/#/profile/123`), the browser handles the routing on the client side,
      so this workaround is not necessary and would add unneeded complexity. Our setup is already robust.
